# Block-Breaker-in-Racket

This game was developed by:
- Gheorghe-Florin Hasna
- Sadik Hyseni
- Fares Eisa

Why did we develop the game?

We are students at Middlesex University of London and Block Breaker is a classic arcade-style game that was created as a project in the first year for Design module. It was developed by us to complete our task with designing a simple game using basic coding, design principles and testing techniques. The goal of the game is to break all the blocks on the screen by bouncing a ball off a paddle at the bottom of the screen.



How to run the game?

•	Download the Racket file “Block Breaker.rkt” or copy the code in a new one.

•	Make sure “config.json” is in the same directory with the racket file.

•	Open and run the code in DrRacket.
